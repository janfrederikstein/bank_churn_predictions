# bank_churn_predictions

### Work in Progress

The plan for this project is to create an artificial neural network that can assist with identifying customers in a bank dataset that are at risk of churning. Such predictions could greatly assist the bank in both retention efforts of the customers in question, as well as in preventative work to remedy future churn issues.

Whilst this might not be the most suitable dataset for the task, one of my motivations is to try out some new things with ANN's such as automated hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV and a keras wrapper on a dataset that I recognize and understand well.
