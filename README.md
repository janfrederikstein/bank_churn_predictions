# bank_churn_predictions

### Work in Progress

The plan for this project is to create an artificial neural network that can assist with identifying customers in a bank dataset that are at risk of churning. Such predictions could greatly assist the bank in both retention efforts of the customers in question, as well as in preventative work to remedy future churn issues.
